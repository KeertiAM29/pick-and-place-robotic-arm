# 🤖 Pick and Place System using ARM7 (LPC2148)

This project is a simple automation system designed using the ARM7-based LPC2148 microcontroller. It uses an IR sensor to detect objects, a DC motor to grip them, and a stepper motor to rotate and place them in another location.

## 📌 Problem Statement

In a factory setup, there’s a need to automate the process of picking and placing lightweight objects. This project solves that using embedded systems with a focus on cost-effectiveness and efficiency.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect objects using IR sensor
- Pick object using DC motor
- Rotate arm using Stepper motor
- Place the object at a target location
- Alert user with a buzzer when an object is detected

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Microcontroller: LPC2148 (ARM7)
- Programming: Embedded C
- Simulation Tools: Keil µVision, Proteus
- Components: IR sensor, DC motor, Stepper motor, Buzzer

## ✅ Project Status

🎉 Successfully implemented and tested with small, lightweight objects. Ideal for educational and low-cost industrial use.
